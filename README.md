# TanStack Table

This project demonstrates the integration of **TanStack Table (React Table v8)** with **Chakra UI** to build dynamic, responsive, and customizable data tables in React.

## Features

* **Dynamic Data Rendering:** Efficiently display tabular data with sorting, filtering, and pagination.
* **Chakra UI Integration:** Modern, accessible, and theme-ready UI components.
* **Customizable Columns:** Text, number, and date-based columns with easy configuration.
* **Advanced Table Features:** Support for global filters, column filters, and custom cell rendering.
* **Component-Based Structure:** Organized, reusable components like `BasicTable`, `AdvancedTable`, `CustomTable`.

## Components Overview

* **MyTableExample:** Demonstrates core table functionality.
* **BasicTable:** Simple static table with minimal configuration.
* **AdvancedTable:** Includes sorting, filtering, and dynamic data handling.
* **CustomTable:** Shows how to create fully customized cells and layouts.

## Technologies Used

* **React** – Frontend library for building UI components.
* **TanStack Table** – Headless table library for complex data grids.
* **Chakra UI** – Component library for consistent and accessible design.
* **Vite** – Fast build tool for modern React applications.

## How It Works

The project uses **TanStack Table hooks** to manage table state and logic, while **Chakra UI** handles presentation. This separation ensures flexibility – you focus on data handling while UI remains customizable.
